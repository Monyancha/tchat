# tChat

tChat is a dating app that allows users from nontraditional gender identities
to feel free to be themselves and explore relationships with others in a fun
and healthy setting. The core functionality for this (auth, profiles/profile editing,
browsing users in your area, and messaging) were built over the span of 10 days and
were heavily inspired by design from okCupid.

## Where it will go from here

There are many next steps for this app to go through. Here are a few.

####Core Features

1. Allow users to block other users.
2. Users will have an internal score and ranking based around some basic data (ratio of messages sent to received, block rate compared to others, )
3. Users will have an add user feature if their score is good enough that allows them to add new users through a temporary one sign up code they can send to a friend. Sign up will now mandatae one of these codes to get on.


####General

1. Refactoring of the styling. Come up with a new color scheme and layout that isn't modeled so closely off of another site.
2. Enhance the messaging experience by adding notifications, having timestamps within the messagethread show page, being more clear about read and unread message threads, etc.
3. Set up messaging to use WebSockets so that the experience is much more real time.
4. Implement more robust error handling and notification throughout the applicaiton.
5. General speed improvements throughout the project.
