# tChat

tChat is a dating app that allows users from nontraditional gender identities
to feel free to be themselves and explore relationships with others in a fun
and healthy setting. The core functionality for this (auth, profiles/profile editing,
browsing users in your area, and messaging) were built over the span of 10 days and
were heavily inspired by design from okCupid.

## Where it will go from here

There are many next steps for this app to go through. Here are a few.

1. Enhance the messaging experience by adding notifications, having timestamps within the messagethread show page, being more clear about read and unread message threads, etc.
2. Set up messaging to use WebSockets so that the experience is much more real time.
3. Implement more robust error handling and notification throughout the applicaiton.
4. General speed improvements throughout the project in an attempt to limit the amount of superfluous calls being made.
