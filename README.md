# tChat

tChat is a dating app that allows users from nontraditional gender identities
to feel free to be themselves and explore relationships with others in a fun
and healthy setting. The core functionality for this (auth, profiles/profile editing,
browsing users in your area, and messaging) were built over the span of 10 days and
were heavily inspired by design from okCupid.
